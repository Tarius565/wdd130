      the miniatures displayed on this site.

    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>
      Enjoy viewing my artwork as I continually update and include more and more visually appealing pieces of work and
      also TTRPG miniatures. News will posted here and updates on any future work. The scrolling banner will be updated
      frequently to house the news.

    <h3>Gallery</h3>
    <p>
      Here I will display my artwork in a grid pattern. I will not have any specific links for the pieces however I will
      include a name or description below each of the images displayed to allow for easy identification of the various
      angles that the pictures will represent. So each image can be discerned from others I will also include a border
      around the square area for the images. The description will be similar for each image, "Ice Golem front view 50mm
      in height".
